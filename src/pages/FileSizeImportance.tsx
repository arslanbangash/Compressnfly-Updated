      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">The Digital Storage Revolution</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        In 2025, we're generating more digital content than ever before. From high-resolution photos to 4K videos, 
        our files are getting larger while our need for speed and efficiency continues to grow. Understanding 
        file size optimization has become crucial for both individuals and businesses.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Web Performance Impact</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Website loading speed directly affects user experience and search engine rankings. Google's Core Web Vitals 
        now heavily weight page speed in search results, making file optimization a critical SEO factor.

      <p className="mb-6">
        With businesses increasingly relying on cloud storage, file size directly impacts costs. Optimized files 
        mean lower storage fees, faster backups, and reduced bandwidth usage across your organization.

        In an era of increasing environmental consciousness, file optimization is a simple way to make 
        digital practices more sustainable.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Mobile-First World</h2>
